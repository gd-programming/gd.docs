# Client Level Resource

## Level

A level is a playable object in Geometry Dash, namely coming with data that explains on what it is, and the string that the client interprets, known as a level string. It is stored in [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) format, and each level entry is a dictionary, containing key/value pairs denoting the level's properties.

**Last Editor State Key/Value Pairs**
The last editor state key/value pairs contain a few values that indicate the last state of the editor before exiting the editor on that level.

| Key | Name/Value               | Type           | Description                              |
| :-- | :----------------------- | :------------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| kI1 | Editor Camera X Position | **float**      | the X position of the editor camera      |
| kI2 | Editor Camera Y Position | **float**      | the Y position of the editor camera      |
| kI3 | Editor Camera Zoom       | **float**      | the zoom level of the editor camera      |
| kI4 | Build Tab Page           | **integer**    | the displayed page within the build tab  |
| kI5 | Build Tab                | **integer**    | the selected build tab                   |
| kI6 | Build Tab Pages          | **dictionary** | the last browsed pages of each build tab |
| kI7 | Editor Layer             | **float**      | the zoom level of the editor camera      |

Note that the build tab pages do not depend on the user's button row/column settings. That means, if the settings are changed, the build tab pages will not reflect the correct changes. For example:

The build tab page is 5, and the button settings are 6x2 (default), meaning the currently shown elements range from `5 * 6 * 2` = 60 to `6 * 6 * 2 - 1` = 71 (zero-indexed). If the user changes the button settings to 12x3, the tab page will remain as 5, showing elements ranging from `5 * 12 * 3` = 180 to `6 * 12 * 3 - 1` = 215 (zero-indexed).
