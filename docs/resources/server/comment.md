# Server Comment Resource

## Comment

A Comment is a message that the player can create inside of Geometry Dash. There are **Two** types of comments: `Level Comments` and `Account Comments`

> - `Level Comments` can be found after pressing the `i` button which is located on the right side of the level menu which then opens the Comment Menu - you can also view comments by clicking on the comment icon on the player Profile. To Post a comment, the player has to click on the speech bubble icon and they can type their comment. Without any external tools, a comment can be up to **100** Characters in length<br/><br/>
> - `Account Comments` can be found on a user's profile. `Account Comments` are exactly the same as `Level Comments` however the following keys will not affect it: `10, 11, 12`<br/>To Upload an Account Comment the player must click the speech bubble icon on their profile and they can type their comment. Without any external tools, a comment can be up to **140** Characters in length

### Comment Object

A comment object is split into two sections: a `Comment String` and an `Author String`. these two strings are divided by a `:`

> - The `Comment String` contains all the data regarding the comment itself<br/><br/>
> - The `User String` contains all the data regarding the user who is commenting

The `Comment String` and `User String` are both structured with a `key~value~key~value` pairing. Here is some examples of raw responses from the server

#### **Level Comment Example**
```md
2~R0QgRG9jcyBhcmUgZXBpYw==~3~84696119~4~0~7~0~10~0~9~2 seconds~6~12872819:1~TheWylieMaster~9~1~10~4~11~16~14~3~15~2~16~9276649       
```

#### **Account Comment Example**
```md
2~R0QgRG9jcyBhcmUgZXBpYw==~4~11~9~3 months~6~18083050
```

<!-- tabs:end -->

Each `key` is tied to a component within the client and the `value` sets data for the specific component.  
A list of all known keys can be found in the table below

### Comment Structure

**Note:** Keys marked with an asterisk `*` do not affect `Account Comments`

| Key | Name/Value                | Type                                         | Description

### User Structure
  
**Note:** These values are only returned through `Level Comments`

| Key | Name/Value                | Type                                         | Description

### Comment Bans

If a user violates [the commenting rules](https://imgur.com/a/US0Biaj), they can be banned from posting comments.
> As of Geometry Dash version 2.11, there are 2 different types of bans<br/>  
> - Permanent Bans - Only way to recieve one is by RobTop directly. The server response to trigger this is `-10`  
> - Temporary Bans - Elder Moderators and RobTop are able to enforce these onto people. The server response to trigger temporary bans is split into 3 components `temp_{length}_{reason}`

#### Temporary Ban Structure

| Component | Description |
|:----------|:------------|
| `temp` | is used for the game to identify if the user is banned |
| `length` | The duration of the ban in seconds |
| `reason` | The reason the user was banned |

### Trivia

- The `User String` uses the same response parser that [player profiles](/docs/resources/server/user.md) use

- The only example of `Account Comments` where it was able to display a colour is with [RobTop's](https://gdbrowser.com/u/71) profile, this is because RobTop hardcoded the account colour into the accountID of `71`
