# Server Gauntlet Resource

## Gauntlet Info

Gauntlets are a collection of themed levels created by the users of Geometry Dash which were hand-picked by RobTop.

 - As of Geometry Dash 2.11, There are `15 gauntlets`

  - According to the [December 2019 2.2 leaks](https://www.reddit.com/r/geometrydash/comments/e9b0y6/update_22_leaks_megathread/), 2.2 will include `44 Gauntlets`
    - **A list of the Gauntlet Names can be found [here](/docs/resources/server/gauntlet.md?id=gauntlet-names)**<br/>*Keep in mind that these are subject to change*

A typical gauntlet server response is structured with a `key:value:key:value` pairing and is then split with a `|`
<!-- tabs:start -->

#### **Gauntlet Example Response**
```md
1:1:3:27732941,28200611,27483789,28225110,27448202|1:2:3:20635816,28151870,25969464,24302376,27399722 
```
<!-- tabs:end -->

Each `key` is tied to a component within the client and the `value` sets data for the specific component.  
A list of all known keys can be found in the table below
