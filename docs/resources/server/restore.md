# Server Restore Resource

## RestoreGJItems

`Restore` was a feature used in Geometry dash from versions `1.7 - 2.0` and it was used as an alternative to the **Account System** that is currently used as of 2.11

A typical Gauntlet Server response is structured with a `key:value:key:value` pairing  
*Official Levels behave a bit differently as you will find out further into his page*

#### Official Level Structure

There are three sections in regards to the `Official Level State` from the restore endpoint. The data is sent as `{NormalCompleted},{PracticeComepleted},{SecretCoins}`

> - `{NormalCompleted}` is a `Bool` which denotes if you have completed the level in normal Mode<br/><br/>
> - `{PracticeComepleted}` is a `Bool` which denotes if you have completed the level in practice Mode<br/><br/>
> - `{SecretCoins}` is an `Integer` which includes the ammount of Secret Coins you collected during the completion of the official level

**<h4/>This structure is then iterated for each official level in the update and is split with a `;`**
