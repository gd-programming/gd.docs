# Server Friend Request Resource

## Friend Request

A friend request is an invite with a message that you can send to someone to invite them to be friends with you on Geometry Dash.

#### Friend Request Structure

**Note:** We will use "other user" to describe the user on the other side of the friend request, be it the receiving end or the sending end.
