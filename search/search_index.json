There are 3 capacity sizes size Batch Type 999 BatchNode 200 EffectBatchNode 100 BatchNodeText If enabled, the Capacity string is disregarded and these values are used instead. Capacity String Generation The Capacity String is only generated during verification of the level. When playing the level, the game stores the the highest number of GameObjects that the Batch is responsible for inside its textureAtlas as the capacity. After the level is verified, the following function is called ```cpp // This is only a re-creation of the function used and is not an accurate decompilation // we have refactored the code to make it easier to understand int capacity = BatchNode->getAtlasCapacity(); if(capacity <= 29) return 0; // Increasing the capacity by a small amount to ensure there is enough memory int newCapacity = capacity * 1.1f; // returning the new capacity with a limit of 9999 return std::min(newCapacty, 9999); ``` After the capacity is calculated, it adds the value to the capacity string. Once the entire string is finished, it is then stored in GJGameLevel->CapacityString_ where it will then be sent to the servers during the upload","title":"Capacity String"},{"location":"resources/client/level-components/capacity-string/#capacity-string","text":"The Capacity String (commonly known as the extra string ) is a long string split up into 54 components each having an Integer assigned to them.

However when these files are written to the disk they are encrypted and have to be decrypted before they can be read or modified. Both files share the same process for decryption and encryption. Decryption Windows Local game files are decrypted in the following order: Apply XOR function with key 0xB ( 11 ), then apply B64 decoding , the resulting byte sequence will be a gzip compressed string which needs to be decompressed/inflated. Simple XOR function differs can be written like this: Python def xor ( string : str , key : int ) -> str : return ( \"\" ) . join ( chr ( ord ( char ) ^ key ) for char in string ) Programmatically decryption can be implemented like so: Python import base64 import gzip def decrypt_data ( data : str ) -> str : base64_decoded = base64 . urlsafe_b64decode ( xor ( data , key = 11 ) . encode ()) decompressed = gzip . decompress ( base64_decoded ) return decompressed . decode () MacOS On MacOS, decryption is quite simpler. Saves are encrypted with AES , using ECB mode. 256-bit key for encryption looks like this: Plain 69 70 75 39 54 55 76 35 34 79 76 5d 69 73 46 4d 68 35 40 3b 74 2e 35 77 33 34 45 32 52 79 40 7b Python KEY = ( # python will automatically concatenate two parts b \" \\x69\\x70\\x75\\x39\\x54\\x55\\x76\\x35\\x34\\x79\\x76\\x5d\\x69\\x73\\x46\\x4d \" b \" \\x68\\x35\\x40\\x3b\\x74\\x2e\\x35\\x77\\x33\\x34\\x45\\x32\\x52\\x79\\x40\\x7b \" ) Here is how actual decryption would be implemented: Python from Crypto.Cipher import AES def remove_pad ( data : bytes ) -> bytes : last = data [ - 1 ] if last < 16 : data = data [: - last ] return data def mac_decrypt ( data : bytes ) -> str : cipher = AES . new ( KEY , AES .

Python def encrypt_data ( data : str ) -> str : gzipped = gzip . compress ( data . encode ()) base64_encoded = base64 . urlsafe_b64encode ( gzipped ) return xor ( base64_encoded . decode (), key = 11 ) MacOS Like on Windows, encryption and decrypion are almost the same: Python from Crypto.Cipher import AES def add_pad ( data : bytes ) -> bytes : len_r = len ( data ) % 16 if len_r : to_add = 16 - len_r data += to_add . to_bytes ( 1 , \"little\" ) * to_add return data def mac_encrypt ( data : str ) -> bytes : cipher = AES . new ( KEY , AES .
